# CryptoFund

This project is my  Cyberlab's Winter of Code 6.0 Submission. It is a frontend of a cryptocurrency-based fundraiser (Problem Statement 1), which focuses on the basic functionaties of a crowdfunding website along with a visually appealing and smooth user experience.

To start the project, First download all the files from index.html.It contains a file called homepage.html which is the main HTML file and all the files are linked to it, so you can access all other files through it; you also see files separately. homepage.css is the css file of homepage.html, and javascript.js is the js file of homepage.html.

Further, card1.html,card2.html ... are HTML files of the cards displayed in the website's "Popular Fundraisers" section. They include their CSS and js. All the options in the navbar have their separate files and the names of the files are the same  as the option name. As a frontend-only project, it only functions somewhat, but I have tried to make it as accurate as possible. I hope you like it
