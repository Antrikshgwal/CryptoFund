        <h1>Crowdfunding Explained</h1>
    </header>

    <div>
        <p>Crowdfunding is a dynamic and collaborative way of funding projects and ventures by gathering small contributions from a large number of people, typically through online platforms. This approach empowers creators to bring their ideas to life while engaging a diverse community of backers.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The term "crowdfunding" was coined in 2006, and the concept has since evolved into a transformative force in the world of finance and innovation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Types of Crowdfunding</h2>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>1. Reward-Based Crowdfunding:</strong></p>
            <p>Reward-based crowdfunding involves backers receiving tangible rewards or products in return for their financial support. These rewards can range from exclusive access to early product releases or other perks related to the project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>2. Equity-Based Crowdfunding:</strong></p>
            <p>Equity-based crowdfunding allows backers to invest in a project or company in exchange for equity or shares. Investors become stakeholders in the venture and stand to gain from its success through dividends or capital appreciation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>3. Donation-Based Crowdfunding:</strong></p>
            <p>Donation-based crowdfunding focuses on raising funds for a cause or project without offering financial returns. Contributors support the project because they believe in the cause and want to make a positive impact on society.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>4. Debt-Based Crowdfunding (Peer-to-Peer Lending):</strong></p>
            <p>Debt-based crowdfunding, also known as peer-to-peer lending, involves individuals lending money to a project or business with the expectation of repayment with interest. This model resembles traditional loans but operates in an online environment.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Choosing the right type of crowdfunding depends on the nature of the project, the goals of the creators, and the expectations of the backers. Each type offers a unique set of benefits and considerations, providing a diverse range of options for both creators and supporters.</p>

        <p>Whether you are an entrepreneur launching a startup, a creative individual with a passion project, or a supporter looking to contribute to meaningful causes, crowdfunding serves as an inclusive and accessible platform for financial collaboration.</p>
