                <h3>Antriksh Gwal</h3>
                <p>23je0125 | Chemical Engineering</p>
                <p>My genuine passion for learning, particularly in blockchain technology and 
                    cryptocurrencies, sets me apart. I was curious and intrigued by blockchain even 
                    before Cyberlab's Blockchain division introduced it again in the workshops.
                    I am excited about the chance to learn and implement innovative features of 
                    blockchain technology. Known for adaptability, I am committed to meeting project 
                    milestones efficiently.
                    While I might not be the most intelligent candidate for this project, I assure you that 
                    I will be the most dedicated and hardworking. I see this project as a learning 
                    opportunity and look forward to enthusiastically contributing to its success.
